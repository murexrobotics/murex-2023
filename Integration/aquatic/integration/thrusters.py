"""
Contains all code nececary to control thrusters. Use the methods 
to interact with thrusters, rather than interacting directly 
with _thrusters, the thrusters are represented with Adafruit Servo 
Class. While this is convenient for PWM, this does not reflect the 
actual usage of the thrusters and can be misleading to someone who 
is not familiar with the codebase.

Note: Importing a module runs all the code inside of it,
however, python modules are also singleton by nature. At 
any given time only one instance can be created. Thus the 
code in this file will run only once, on the first import, 
making it suitable for initialization

See individual functions for more information

Example:
--------
```Python
#intialize thrusters
import thrusters
# initialize gamepad
import gamepad

thrusters.adjust_magnitudes(gamepad)
...
```

Constants:
----------
    THRUSTER_INIT_TIME (int): Time in seconds to wait for thrusters to initialize
    MIN_PLUSE_WIDTH (int): Minimum pulse width for thrusters
    MAX_PLUSE_WIDTH (int): Maximum pulse width for thrusters

    STOP_DUTY_CYCLE (int): Duty cycle for thrusters to stop
    MAX_DUTY_CYCLE (int): Maximum duty cycle for thrusters
    MIN_DUTY_CYCLE (int): Minimum duty cycle for thrusters


Functions:
----------
    set_thrusts(*thrusts):
        Sets the thrust of each thruster

    adjust_magnitudes(gamepad: Gamepad):
        Adjusts the thrust of each thruster based on the gamepad

    telemetry():
        Returns a dictionary of telemetry data

        
Todo:
-----
    * Abstract parts of thruster code to work with BLDC motors
    * More + Better logging
    * Implement set_thrusters from the original integration code
